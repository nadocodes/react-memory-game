My Awesome Vite App: Nado's React Memory Game
=============================================

This is my awesome Vite app created with the [Create Vite App](https://github.com/vitejs/create-vite-app) tool. It is a simple boilerplate application that you can use to kickstart your project.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```<bash>
    `git clone https://github.com/nadocodes/react-memory-game.git`
    ```

2.  Change into the app's directory:
    ```<bash>
    `cd react-memory-game`
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```<bash>
    npm install
    ```

4.  Start the app:
    ```<bash>
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser.

Available Scripts
-----------------

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.<br> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br> You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br> It correctly bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
